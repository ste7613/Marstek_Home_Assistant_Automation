This is just an automation for Home Assistant.
It is an alternative to the internal control system of the Marstek Venus v2, which is unstable and cannot detect a charging BEV.
The Marstek's WiFi can be turned off. Communication takes place via the Modbus protocol thanks to the integration of https://github.com/ViperRNMC/marstek_venus_modbus.
